### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for coming to check out my profile and what I have created so far!

My name is Henry Hagemann, but I go by Dalton. You can also reach me at hdhagemann@my.waketech.edu  
MY GitHub account is brand new, not even a day old yet.. But I am looking forward to continue to learn more about this side
  of technology and broaden my scope of understanding.

So far my repository is a simple assignment that our class completed. It was designing and creating a portfolio website using a WYSIWYG editor
  and also jumping into coding with html and css. Although it isn't a professional level, and I have much to learn still, it was a great first 
  experience working with the Adobe Dreamweaver application.

In order to clone the repository onto my Desktop, I downloaded the Windows version of GitHub and signed into the account I created online. As I had already
  created my repository, I was able to use my account to copy the repository I had created and save it to a designated location on my computer.
